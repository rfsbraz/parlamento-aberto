# parlamento-aberto

Clean, versioned, documented open data about the Assembleia da República, rebuilt from the official open data dumps. The raw source lives in git under `data/`, so every change the AR makes shows up as a reviewable diff, and each data release publishes Parquet and CSV tables built from it.

Fonte: Assembleia da República, dados abertos.

The AR allows free reuse of its open data as long as the source is credited. Terms: https://www.parlamento.pt/Cidadania/Paginas/DadosAbertos.aspx

## Licences

- Code: MIT (`LICENSE`).
- Data: CC BY 4.0 (`LICENSE-DATA`), for everything under `data/` and the published marts.

## Personal data

Biographies, birth dates and interest registers are personal data. This repo republishes only what the AR publishes.

To report wrong data, open an issue with the [Correção de dados](../../issues/new?template=correcao-de-dados.yml) form. Personal-data removal requests can use the same form, or GitHub private vulnerability reporting once the repo is public. Please do not paste the personal data itself into a public issue.
